# Spielwarenladen_DB_Prakt_SoSe2021
Project made during the summer semester of 2021 by Lisa Tochtermann, Emanuel Petrinovic and Lena Gerner. 

The goal of this project was to simulate a sitatuion/problem where a DBMS could solve a problem. The students where given the freedom to choose the scenario themselves. We choose a toy store who wants to extend his business practices, enhance his online store and try to get new customers.
